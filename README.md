1. **Ensure the file is saved with a `.md` extension**: For Markdown files, it should be a `.md` file like `README.md`.

2. **No raw code display**: Sometimes, GitHub or other platforms will display HTML or Markdown code as raw text if it's not properly formatted or if there's an issue in the way the file is uploaded.

3. **Test locally**: You can use a Markdown preview tool or a local GitHub repository to check how the README will render before pushing it online.

4. **Avoid escaping HTML tags**: Ensure that you aren't escaping the `<` and `>` tags in the HTML elements.

Here is a fixed version of the code that should render correctly on platforms like GitHub:
